      <h2>About the app</h2>
      <p>This application is an example app made for the fictional teaching supply agency, Top Teachers. It allows recruitment agencies looking to enter the mobile world with their own app to see what is possible. As a demo application your data will only be viewed by Teachmatic Ltd employees.</p>
      <p>If you are an agency and want your own app we can either start with this app as a template, customising it to your brand and requirements or start from scratch for a completely bespoke package.</p>      
      <h2>Find out more</h2>
      <p>Teachmatic are a software development firm that develop bespoke mobile apps for the Recruitment industry. If you have any questions you can contact us at <a href="http://www.teachmatic.com">teachmatic.com</a>.</p>      
      <h2>Using the app</h2>
      <h3>Availability</h3>
      <p>Our availability screen allows you to update your agency's availability records instantly. Tap an uncoloured date to mark yourself as unavailable (the date will change to red). Tap it again to set yourself to available. When you are happy with your changes just tap <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
      <p>Changes are automatically synced with our system to become instantly available to agency consultants.</p>
      <h3>Timesheets</h3>
      <p>You can submit and view timesheets quickly on the app.</p>
      <p>Get started by hitting <strong>Create Timesheet</strong> from the main menu. Select a school by typing the school name and selecting an option from the returned results. For the demo we show every school in the UK so you may see a lot of results.</p>
      <p>On the next screen tap Full, AM or PM to indicate the periods of the week that you worked and then hit <strong>Preview</strong>.</p>
      <p>You are now given a final chance to check the timesheet before hitting <strong>Submit</strong>. Once submitted it will electronically be sent to the client for approval. Once approved it will be sent to the agency payroll department, ready for you to get paid. As this is a demo application it will not be sent to any external parties.</p>
      <h4>Tracking your timesheets</h4>
      <p>Back in the main menu you can track the progress of your timesheets and see your historical timesheets by selecting <strong>My Timesheets</strong>.</p>
      <p>This screen shows you all your timesheets grouped by week, starting with the most recent. The timesheet status will be updated as your timesheets are approved.</p>
